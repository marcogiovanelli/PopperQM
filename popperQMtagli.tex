\todo{In classical physics, controllable and conditional selections are interchangeable. For instance, in an elastic collision where $p_A + p_B = p_0$, conditioning on $p_A = p_A’$ merely picks out those systems in which $B$ has $p_B = p_0 - p_A’$—exactly the same subensemble one would obtain by controllably filtering the events where $B$ has that momentum. In quantum physics, they are not interchangeable: conditional selection merely updates our knowledge about $B$ given a measurement outcome on A, which, however, depends on the choice of $A$’s preparation; it does not correspond to a new, controllably prepared ensemble of $B$-particles. In the classical case, if one actively filters out all collisions where the outgoing momentum of $A$ has a specific value $p_A$, one automatically selects a subensemble of events in which $B$ has the corresponding momentum $p_B$. However, in the quantum case, selecting $A$ for position would necessarily spread the momentum distribution of $B$, so that no definite $p_B$ can be assigned}

%%In Popper's setup, after the collision at $S$, the $A$-particles possess different momenta; one can select a sub-ensemble of particles with the same sharp momentum by applying, for example, an accelerating potential. However, in \qm\ such a selection does not assign a definite momentum to any \emph{individual} particle; it merely defines a new, anonymous \s{pure} ensemble of systems. It therefore makes no sense to claim, as Popper suggests, that the \emph{same} electron that passes through the filter already possessed the \emph{same} momentum beforehand. Consequently, the assertion that the position of that \emph{same} electron, although unknown, remains unchanged, cannot be upheld within the quantum-mechanical formalism. It is particularly ironic that Popper appeals precisely to this \s{anonymity} argument when discussing position measurement.

%To do something more, I have also considered your suggestion of using a light filter. I imagine the experiment, in order to make it as physically simple as possible, as follows: In this way, only the light of the resonance line is reflected, while light of other frequencies passes through. Basically, this experiment is nothing other than the well-known method of residual rays. Now, the accuracy of the momentum measurement of the light quantum is evidently determined by the width of the resonance line. It holds that 
%\[
%\Delta p = \frac{h \Delta r}{e} \, ,
%\]
%and, on the other hand, the probable residence time of the light quantum in the reflecting atom is given by the lifetime...


%In response to Popper’s suggestion that one might use a light filter to measure the momentum of a photon with arbitrary precision, Heisenberg proposed a simple physical model based on Wood’s resonance–reflection experiments. He imagined a beam of inhomogeneous light reflected from a vapor, such as sodium or mercury vapor, which acts as a resonance filter: it reflects only photons whose frequency coincides with an atomic resonance line, while light of other frequencies passes through. 

%Heisenberg pointed out that the accuracy of the photon’s momentum measurement is limited by the width of the resonance line~$\Delta \nu$. The narrower the line, the more precisely one knows the photon’s frequency and thus its momentum, given by $\Delta p = h \Delta \nu / c$. Yet, the finite width of the line arises from the finite lifetime of the excited atomic state, $\Delta t \approx 1 / \Delta \nu$. During this time the photon is absorbed and re-emitted, so the instant and position of reflection cannot be sharply defined. Even if the photon’s position is known exactly at a later time, its position at the moment of reflection remains uncertain by $\Delta x = c \Delta t = c / \Delta \nu$. Combining these relations yields, at least heuristically, $\Delta x \, \Delta p \approx h$, that is, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. 



%Each angle of scattering corresponds to a different momentum component $p_y$. The narrower the slit (smaller \Delta y), the wider the diffraction pattern (larger \Delta p_y). 



% predictive (or preparative) selection: Once one repeatedly fails to construct such a perpetual motion machine, one can either (a) give up and accept energy conservation or (b) devise a different setup that would ultimately violate it. Popper clearly adopted the second attitude.  %The argument developed by Popper 1 is invalid not because of some unjustified assumption about the source but, rather, because the universally accepted rules of quantum mechanics, even in the Copenhagen interpretation, do not entail what Popper claims them to entail.


%The term is due to Weyl (Zeitschrift fur Physik 46, 1927, p. 1) and J. von Neumann
%(Göttinger Nachrichten, 1927, p. 245). If, following Weyl (Gruppentheorie und Quanten-
%mechanik, p. 70; English translation p. 79; cf. also Born-Jordan, Elementare Quanten-mechanik,
%p. 315), we characterize the pure case as one ‘. . . which it is impossible to produce

%satisfying this description need not be pure momentum or place selections. They could
%be produced, for example, if a place-selection were eﬀected with some chosen degree
%of precision, and the momentum with the greatest precision still attainable.

%Popper asked \Weis whether an ensemble of type~(1b) could be called a \s{\emph{pure case}}. He replied that this was not the common parlance---a pure case having only one variable sharp---, but that no specific term existed for the case in which both momentum and position are sharp. For this reason, Popper coined the expression \s{\emph{super-pure case}}, which he used thereafter to label what von~\citet{Neumann1932} called a homogeneous dispersion-free ensemble .

%Weisskopf suggested that Popper might cite him in a note as having had discussions with him, if such a form seemed appropriate. Otherwise, Popper was, of course, free to use any of the arguments they had discussed. This is indeed, what Popper did referring quasi-verbatim to this letter.

%Heisenberg—who speaks of measuring or observing rather than of selecting—presents the
%situation, in form of a description of an imaginary experiment, as follows: if we wish to
%observe the position of the electron, we must use high frequency light which will strongly
%interact with it, and thus disturb its momentum. If we wish to observe its momentum,
%then we must use low frequency light which does leave its momentum (practically)
%unchanged, but cannot help us to determine its position. It is important that in this
%discussion the uncertainty of the momentum is due to disturbance, while the uncertainty of the position is not
%due to anything of the sort. Rather it is the result of avoiding any strong disturbance of the
%system. (See appendix *xi, point 9.)
%My old argument (which was based upon this observation) proceeded now as follows.
%Since a determination of the momentum leaves the momentum unchanged because it
%interacts weakly with the system, it must also leave its position unchanged, although it
%fails to disclose this position. But the undisclosed position may later be disclosed by a
%second measurement; and since the first measurement left the state of the electron
%(practically) unchanged, we can calculate the past of the electron not only between the two measurements, but also before the first measurement. his argument. (In other words, I still believe that my argument and my experiment of section 77 can be used to point out an inconsistency in Heisenberg’s discussion of the observation of an electron.) But I now believe that I was wrong in assuming that what holds for Heisenberg’s imaginary ‘observations’ or ‘measurements’ would also hold for my ‘selections’. As Einstein shows (in appendix *xii), it does not hold for a filter acting upon a light quantum. Nor does it hold for the electric field perpendicular to the direction of a beam of electrons, mentioned (like the filter) in the first paragraph of the present appen- dix. For the width of the beam must be considerable if the electrons are to move parallel to the x-axis, and as a consequence, their position before their entry into the field cannot be calculated with precision after they have been deflected by the field. This invalidates the argument of this appendix and the next, and of section 77.

%Hence, narrowing the frequency band $\Delta \nu$—that is, making the filter more selective in momentum—should, according to Popper, \emph{reduce} the spatial smearing rather than increase it! This is exactly the opposite of what the \IR\ implies. Popper can however counter, that the \IR\ expressed merely statistical relations limiting the homogeneity of an ensemble of light quanta, not constraints on individual ones.

%To construct a filter of type II, Popper suggests using colored glass filters followed by gas layers. Colored glass filters allow a relatively broad band of wavelengths to pass while blocking the others. They do not sharply distinguish between single frequencies, but rather transmit a whole range of nearby wavelengths, thereby acting as coarse selectors. Gas layers, by contrast, work according to a much sharper principle: they absorb light quanta whose energies coincide with their resonance frequencies, while letting light quanta with off-resonance energies pass essentially unchanged. In this way, two distinct outcomes arise. Photons that are on resonance are absorbed and subsequently re-emitted, which blurs their direction and timing. Photons that are off resonance, on the other hand, traverse the gas layer without disturbance, preserving their original properties. Momentum is unchanged, position is unknown, unless one admits action at a distance.\todo{circumvent Heisenberg's objection}

%E.g. The momentum $p$ of an electron can be obtained by measuring position $q_0$ and $q_1$ at different times. If the time intervals between such position measurements are chosen to be very large, the momentum of the particle before the last position measurement can be determined with arbitrary accuracy . However, the momentum after the second position measurement, which alone is of physical interest, will, however, not be known with such precision, since the posisition measuremet alterns the the momentum again

% Popper’s assumption that the filter could transmit sharply defined momenta without affecting temporal resolution therefore contradicted the very physical principles of wave propagation and the empirical behavior of real optical media.


%Heisenerg, rejecting the idea of transparent filter, could not work: Both reflection and transmission filtering obey the same uncertainty constraints\footnote{??} In the center of a transmission band, light quanta interact with the medium’s electrons elastically, i.e. without real absorption. Thus, the narrower the transparent band (the closer the band heads), the more likely light quanta are to linger in atoms — i.e. the longer the interaction time. Photons near the edges of the transparent region (the band heads) are actually absorbed with significant probability and re-emitted after a delay roughly equal to the lifetime of the excited state. This means that the narrower the transparent region, the more light quanta fall near the edges and thus the longer the average delay (interaction time).


%He proposed instead a setup that does not absorb light quanta but merely reflects or deflects them according to their momentum — a kind of “reflection filter.”
%
%For instance:
%	•	A diffraction grating, or
%	•	A mirror with a frequency- or angle-dependent reflectivity.
%
%The idea was: if one uses a reflection (instead of an absorbing) filter, then the light quanta are not destroyed and re-emitted; they are simply reflected, supposedly without random delay.
%Popper hoped this would allow a more precise, non-disturbing momentum measurement.

%	•	Narrower frequency window → longer interaction time → worse time resolution.
%	•	Wider window → shorter interaction → worse frequency resolution.
%
%Therefore, no optical filter of any kind (reflective or absorptive) can evade the uncertainty relations.


%On March 19 1935. If a transparete filted, does not work  material transparent only between two absorption lines acts like a filter that passes light quanta of certain energies. The precision with which the photon’s momentum (or energy) can be measured depends on the width and sharpness of those bands.

%This follows from the fact that a momentum measurement collapses the system into a momentum eigenstate, in which position is completely spread out, whereas a position measurement collapses it into a position eigenstate, in which momentum is indeterminate. Each measurement thus defines its own contextual \s{history}, precluding a unified description of the particle’s past trajectory.

%\citep{Hermann1935,Hermann1935a} is closely related to Popper’s statistical interpretation. 

%\footnoteh{A comparison with the EPR shows the reason why. After an elastic scattering (e.g., Compton-type) interaction, the electron and light quantum are in an entangled state. Just like in the EPR paper example, they share the same position $\delta(x_e - x_\text{ph})$  (the point of scattering), but neither has a definite momentum by itself; only the total momentum $\delta(p_e + p_\text{ph})$ is well defined (momentum conservation). Now suppose a momentum \s{selection} is performed on the electron at $X_1$ as in in Popper's setup. The electron collapses into a momentum eigenstate and therefore, as Popper now recognizes, has a completely spread position. Because of momentum conservation the light quantum simultaneously collapses into the corresponding momentum eigenstate. However, for this reason its position becomes completely uncertain.

%A comparison with the EPR situation described by Einstein in 1935 shows the reason why. After the elastic scattering at $S$, particles $A$ and $B$ are in an entangled state. Just like in the EPR example, they share the same position $\delta(x_A - x_B)$ (the point of scattering), but neither has a definite momentum by itself; only the total momentum $\delta(p_A + p_B)$ is well defined (momentum conservation). Now suppose a momentum \s{selection} is performed on $A$ at $X_1$, as in Popper's setup. The $A$ particle collapses into a momentum eigenstate $p_A$ and therefore, as Popper now recognizes, has a completely spread position. Because of momentum conservation, the $B$ particle simultaneously collapses into the corresponding momentum eigenstate $p_B$. However, for this reason, its position becomes completely uncertain. As a consequence, there is no way to exploit momentum conservation to construct a \s{predictive measurement} that yields both sharp $x$ and $p$ for the light quantum.



%However, one might concede to Popper that repeating the experiment many times would yield a statistical distribution of $AB$ particle pairs all with \emph{different}, but correlated position and momenta, but not an ensemble of light quanta all having the \emph{same} position and momentum. One can infer something about $B$ once you measure $A$, but one cannot control or reproduce that same condition on $B$ in the next trial without measuring $A$ again. The problem lies, elsewhere. Popper must have soon realized that the tricks works only if the momentum of $A$ is not changed by the selection at $X_1$, so that entire path of $A$ can be reconstructed up to the collision at $S$.

%He fails to realize that one could, in principle, lower the beam intensity to the point where particles pass one at a time, even without using the shutter \citep[25]{BacciagaluppiCrull2024}. 


%Popper adds, however, an interesting remark. Many \TE{}s aiming to challenge this conclusion consider single \emph{isolated} particles. In such cases, by repeating the experiment many times—each with arbitrarily sharp values of position and momentum—one could, in principle, construct a dispersion-free ensemble. However, in \qm\ experiments one always considers single particles embedded in a \emph{beam}. In this case, even an exceedingly precise determination of the position or momentum of one particle could not be extended to \emph{all} particles in the beam. Thus, repeating the experiment many times would not produce a super-pure case. Popper then insists that his own \TE\ should also be thought of as \q{nur innerhalb eines Teilchenschwarms}. Thus, even if the experiment allows for measuring arbitrarily sharp positions and momenta in a beam, it cannot be used to construct a super-pure case.

%Popper clearly confuses a \emph{beam} of particles with a statistical ensemble of repetitions of the same experiment. Indeed, with a sufficiently weak beam one could, in \qm, legitimately regard it as consisting of isolated particles. However, Popper might have been \s{right for the wrong reasons}. Repeating Popper’s experiment many times yields a statistical distribution of $AB$-pairs, each with different correlated momenta and positions, not an ensemble of $B$-particles all having the \emph{same} position and momentum. One can infer something about $B$ once $A$ is measured, but one cannot control or reproduce that same condition for $B$ in the next trial without measuring $A$ again. The problem is, once again, that in order to predict the position and momentum of the $B$-particle in each run of the experiment, one would need to reconstruct the position-and-momentum state of each corresponding $A$-particle \emph{before} the momentum measurement at $X_1$. In Popper's own words:

In the 1980s, \textcites{Popper1982}{Popper1982b}{Popper1985}{Popper1986}, Popper replaced the ETP-like experiment with an EPR-like one in an attempt to break the relation between preparation and measurement, which, however, was once again based on a \s{gross mistake}.

However, he seems not to have completely appreciated the conceptual reason behind his mistake. In the 1980s, \textcites{Popper1982}{Popper1982b}{Popper1985}{Popper1986}, Popper replaced the ETP-like experiment with an EPR-like experiment. However, one may conclude that Popper made the \s{gross mistake} again when he proposed a \TE\ similar to that of the 1930s. Once again, Popper attempted to bypass the preparation–measurement link, attempting to make predictions using EPR-type relations rather than a conservation law. However, in both cases, the link cannot be bypassed; once again, there was a preparation that Popper failed to recognize. The \qm\ formalism yields \emph{transition probabilities} between an initially prepared state and a possible measurement outcome. Without preparation, a \s{measurement} would have no probabilistic referent. 




%A measured state (or measurement outcome) presupposes that some system has been prepared in a defined initial condition to which the measurement applies.

%However, Popper also seems to address a new objection that he might have received in the meantime, possibly from Weisskopf. From Popper's somewhat indirect response, the objection was probably along the following line: Since Popper's apparatus indeed allows to predict sharp position and momentum for a single particle, it also allows for the production of a super-pure case. By repeating Popper's \s{predictive measurement} on particle $A$ many times, one could select a dispersion-free ensemble of $A$-particles. This, of course, contradicts the \IR\ interpreted statistically. Thus, \latin{contra} Popper, the prohibition of a super-pure case would imply the prohibition of a predictive measurement (425).

%According to Popper, the confusion arises from the fact that most thought experiments used in the quantum dabate are phrased in terms of \emph{isolated} particles. If apparatus would be possible that isolates single particles and tests whether each one lies within very small ranges of position and momentum. Keeping only those that do, would yield a dispersion-free ensemble. However, in \qm\ one always uses \emph{beams} of particles, and thus Popper's experiment should also be understood in this way: it allows predictions for the path of the $A$-particle \q{innerhalb eines Teilchenschwarms} (426). The momentum filter at $X_1$ selects a beam of $A$-particles with identical momenta, while their positions remain statistically distributed. The position of each $A$-particle is determined only after detection at $X_2$, which allows one to reconstruct its path; in each run, however, a different path will be obtained. For \emph{each} $A$-particle, the position and momentum of the correlated $B$-particle can be predicted, but the $A$-distribution remains random. Thus, no super-pure or dispersion-free ensemble of $A$-particles is obtained.

%\q{wenn wir annehmen, daß uns das Meß- verfahren zwarb von einem oder dem anderen Teilchen des Schwarms genaue Kenntnisse liefert, nichtc aber von allen Teilchen eines gewis- sen (raumzeitlichen) Umgebungsbereiches}



%To produce a super-pure case, Popper continues, one would need an additional selection of the incoming $A$ particle at $X_2$. Popper suggests that this could be achieved by means of a shutter or aperture (\german{Blende mit Momentverschluss}) that opens only for a brief instant---exactly at the time when the predicted particle is expected to arrive\footnote{I mention this detail, since Einstein refers to it in his response}. To avoid diffractive disturbance (which would change the particle’s momentum), the aperture must be sufficiently large in space and time. But a large aperture will also let other, nearby particles through (particles about which one has no precise information), so the single particle is not truly isolated. If instead the aperture is made small so that only the predicted particle passes, its smallness (in space or time) increases diffraction and thus disturbs the particle’s momentum—destroying the precise momentum information on which the prediction was based (426)\todo{Asymmetry position momentum?}.



%\begin{itemize}
%\item The filter changes the position. Popper argues that, contrary to a position selection (a narrow slit), which spreads the trajectory of the particle, a momentum selection (an electron spectrometer) lets particles of a certain momentum pass along the same path while blocking the others.\footnote{For the reason of this asymmetry, see below~**.} The assumption that momentum selection disturbs the position of the particles in the direction of flight in an unpredictable manner---that is, that the spatial coordinate of a particle in this direction changes unpredictably as a result of the momentum selection---is, since the velocity is not altered, equivalent to assuming that the particle, as a consequence of the momentum selection, jumps discontinuously (with superluminal speed) to another point along its path. This assumption, however, contradicts (modern) quantum mechanics, which indeed allows discontinuous particle jumps, but only for particles bound within the atom (discrete eigenvalue spectrum), not for free particles (which belong to the continuous eigenvalue spectrum). A theory that---perhaps in order to avoid the conclusions drawn in our text, or to save the uncertainty relations---would modify quantum mechanics so that the assumption of a positional disturbance as a result of momentum selection becomes admissible, could probably be carried out without contradiction, but even such a theory could not account for the observed statistical character of the results.
%
%\item If the position of the electron remains unchanged after the momentum measurement, one could in principle try to construct a \s{super-pure case} by \emph{reversing the normal order of selection}. First, one would perform a \emph{position selection}, localizing the particle very precisely by letting it pass through a narrow slit or a very short \s{momentary shutter} (\german{Momentverschluß}). Then, one would perform a \emph{momentum selection}, using a filter that only transmits particles within a narrow range of momenta. Since this second step seems to leave both momentum and position unchanged, one might believe that the resulting ensemble possesses simultaneously sharp~$\pos$ and sharp~$\mom$. However, the sharper the initial position selection, the smaller the probability that any particles will later pass through the momentum filter. In practice, only after a very large number of trials would a few particles randomly appear behind the filter---and these detections would be purely stochastic. Thus, even if one could obtain some information from such events, it would only concern the \emph{statistical distribution} of properties (for instance, that \s{some particle} in the opposite beam has a certain momentum), but \emph{not} the identity of which individual particle this refers to. Consequently, such a procedure cannot produce an ensemble more \s{pure} than the one already represented by a quantum-mechanical pure state, hut not about individual particles\footnote{See }\todo{no trajectories of single particles} 
%\end{itemize}


%However, one might concede to Popper that repeating the experiment many times would yield a statistical distribution of electron–photon pairs all with \emph{different}, but correlated position and momenta, but not an ensemble of photons all having the \emph{same} position and momentum. One can infer something about $B$ once you measure $A$, but one cannot control or reproduce that same condition on $B$ in the next trial without measuring $A$ again. The problem lies, elsewhere. Popper must have soon realized that the tricks works only if the momentum of $A$ is not changed by the selection at $X_1$, so that entire path of $A$ can be reconstructed up to the collision at $S$.





%Every predictive measurement is, by its very nature, also a preparation, since it leaves the system in a definite state from which further predictions can be made. By contrast, non-predictive measurements may be destructive: they yield information about a single event but do not prepare the system for subsequent observations.
%Non-predictive measurements such measurements do not prepare a useful post-measurement state and may destroy the system.  

%Popper’s idea was to imagine a measurement that gives predictive information about an individual system without preparing it in the corresponding eigenstate.

%In a destructive measurement, there is no surviving post-measurement state; hence the apparatus cannot prepare anything for further prediction. However, it can still serve as a diagnostic of what the preparation must have been.

%Preparation (filter): creates anonymous pure cases — an ensemble, not individuals.

%After all, how could the position change if the momentum remains the same?


%some photons are absorbed and re-emitted through resonance, while others are transmitted directly. He assumed that the latter—those passing through without interaction—must traverse the filter unchanged, retaining the same group velocity as before. Only the absorbed and subsequently re-emitted photons, he argued, could experience delay or blurring. For the directly transmitted photons, by contrast, no mechanism seemed available that could increase their positional spread. Hence, paradoxically, the narrower the frequency band $\Delta \nu$ selected by the filter (smaller $\Delta p$), the smaller the expected spatial dispersion effect—implying a reduction rather than an enlargement of the positional indeterminacy $\Delta q$. This conclusion appeared to stand in clear contrast with the \IR. For Popper, however, the \IR\ expressed merely statistical relations limiting the homogeneity of an ensemble of photons, not constraints on individual ones. The filter, he argued, selects a homogeneous ensemble of photons with the same momentum, whose individual positions remain unknown but unchanged. After all, how could the position change if the momentum remains the same?

\todo{check afgain}




%Popper argued that once a photon has passed through a filter \emph{without being absorbed}, there is no obvious mechanism that could delay or smear its position; all transmitted quanta, he suggested, should traverse the filter with the \emph{same group velocity as before}. Any blurring could only arise if the group velocity depended on wavelength—that is, the only mechanism for broadening a transmitted pulse would be dispersion, due to differences in group velocity across the transmitted frequency band. Yet, he noted, the better a filter of type II selects a narrow frequency band (small $\Delta p$), the smaller this dispersion effect becomes, so that the spatial indeterminacy $\Delta q$ is reduced rather than increased. This seemed to him a striking contrast with the uncertainty relations, which predict that narrowing momentum should enlarge position uncertainty. 



%What he overlooked is that passing through a filter does not simply preserve each photon’s velocity and position; rather, it \emph{prepares} a new quantum state with a correspondingly broadened spatial distribution.

%This argument is, of course, not decisive; it is conceivable that theoretical considerations or the discovery of new effects might compel us to assume that the atoms of the filter absorb the incoming quanta and, after a time interval $\Delta t$ that varies randomly within a certain range (with $\Delta t$ increasing with the strictness of the filter, since otherwise the uncertainty relations would not be preserved), re-emit them in the original direction. Nor do I wish here to invoke the major theoretical difficulties of such an assumption.


%In a diffraction experiment, the position is specified at $x_1$. Ideally, the theory predicts that the particles’ energy—and hence their speed—remains constant, while their direction, and thus momentum, is spread. This can be tested by placing a photographic plate at $x_2$ and observing the distribution of spots. Each spot, a single particle hit at position $\delta y$, can be measured with arbitrary precision, allowing one to determine the angle $\delta \theta$ and the corresponding past momentum $\delta p_y$. The distribution of these past paths must conform to the theory’s predictions; otherwise, the theory must be rejected.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item \emph{Type I apparatus:} An instrument decomposing even short light pulses into its different frequency (or wavelength) components. According to quantum mechanics, the better its spectral resolution, the more it must blur the positions of the light quanta along the beam direction. Otherwise, it would allow the realization of an impossible case: a pulse that is both short (localized in time) and monochromatic. After momentum measurement, quanta that had nearly identical positions before would then arrive at the counter at very different times. (The actual existence of such an apparatus is doubtful, but this does not affect the argument.)
%  \item \emph{Type II apparatus:} An instrument that does not resolve short pulses but only infinitely long wave trains. Short light pulses are merely attenuated, more or less, depending on duration (in extreme cases, either fully transmitted or fully blocked). The plausibility of such devices arises from the symmetry between monochromaticity with respect to beam width and beam duration: a truly monochromatic wave must be both infinitely wide and infinitely long. Known devices, such as diffraction gratings, already select momentum more precisely the wider the incident beam, differing from Type II only in that their resolution decreases with beam width rather than beam duration.
%\end{itemize}

%  \item  A purely hypothetical device that could spectrally analyze \emph{all} pulses, including arbitrarily short ones. If such an instrument existed, it would perfectly illustrate the uncertainty principle: sharper momentum resolution would necessarily blur position.

%  \item \emph{Type II apparatus:} A more realistic filter, which does not resolve short pulses but only acts on infinitely long, strictly monochromatic wave trains. Short pulses are merely attenuated. Popper suggested that such filters might avoid producing additional positional blurring and thus could serve as a loophole to the orthodox interpretation.  
%further subdivide a quantum-mechanical ensemble into sub-ensembles– let alone into individual trajectories

%Nothing allows us, in advance, to divide the ensemble into subsets with different individual decay constants — there are no “slow” and “fast” atoms hidden inside. The decay is fundamentally stochastic and homogeneous across the ensemble. Hence, in predictive terms, you cannot meaningfully speak of sub-ensembles with different average lifetimes: all members share the same decay probability law.


%Once time has passed and some nuclei have decayed, one can retroactively classify them: those that decayed early, those that survived longer, etc. Now you can define sub-ensembles according to the observed outcome (decay time).
%For example: all nuclei that decayed before $t_1$, those that survived until $t_2$, and so on, But this classification is retrodictive — it’s only possible after the decay has occurred, not before. It’s a contextual subdivision defined by measurement results, not by intrinsic pre-existing properties.

%Predictively: the ensemble is homogeneous; no further subdivision is meaningful — every nucleus obeys the same decay probability.
%Retrodictively: once events have occurred, we can separate outcomes and speak of sub-ensembles, but this distinction depends on context (the time of observation or the measurement of decay).

%For example, a sample of undecayed radioactive nuclei, all characterized by the same average half-life, cannot be subdivided into sub-ensembles with different predicted average lifetimes: the decay law applies uniformly to all members of the ensemble. Only retroactively, after some or all of the nuclei have decayed, can one distinguish subgroups according to the actual decay times. Such a subdivision, however, is purely contextual—it reflects the measurement outcomes, not pre-existing differences in the prepared ensemble.

%Logical problems begin when such propositions are truncated by omission of reference to the preparation and/or registration.




%One can achieve a non-predictive reconstructions of past trajectories, yet only \emph{between} a selection and a subsequent measurement. Popper's \s{coupling hypothesis},  is not an additional hypothesis, is an integral part of \qm. It is nothing but the statement that all predictions in quantum theory concern \emph{transition probabilities} form the from the prepared state to measurement state. In this sense, the coupling is not a contingent feature of the setup — it is constitutive of what prediction means in quantum mechanics. based on a mistake.


%General Principle. — In attempts such as the ETP and Popper schemes, triangulation based on conservation laws or relative correlations fails because the path of the particles cannot be reconstructed prior to measurement. A momentum measurement necessarily destroys positional (and thus temporal) information, so the time of interaction cannot be inferred. More generally, no correlation can circumvent the preparation–measurement link: one may predict with certainty either position or momentum, but never both simultaneously, and the \IR\ always reasserts itself at the level of the correlations.

%However, this triangulation fails, since the correlations do not provide simultaneous sharp values of complementary observables: one can predict either position or momentum with certainty, depending on the measurement performed on $A$, but not both at once. 

%Thus the time of the particle’s passage cannot be reconstructed.

%His scheme relies on using momentum conservation to infer position as well, but the act of measuring momentum already destroys the sharpness of positional information, so the attempt to circumvent the \IR does not succeed.

%In classical physics, correlations arise from conservation laws. For example, if a particle at rest decays into two fragments, conservation of momentum ensures they fly apart with equal speeds in opposite directions. Measuring the momentum of one immediately gives that of the other, since each momentum \s{exists} independently of measurement. In quantum mechanics, however, the outcome for the first particle is random, and in an entangled pair no definite momentum eigenstate can be assigned in advance. Yet once one particle’s momentum is measured, the other’s can be predicted; and if one instead measures position, the partner’s position can likewise be predicted.

%\cop{In classical physics, correlations often arise due to certain conservation laws. For example, a particle at rest may decay into two identical fragments that, due to the conservation of total momentum, will then fly apart at the same speed but in opposite directions. If we measure the momentum of one of the fragments, we can therefore immediately infer that the momentum of the other particle must be equal in magnitude but of opposite sign.}. This seems straightforward in classical physics: \cop{The momentum of each fragment \s{exists} independently of the measurement performed on the first fragment, and the inference of the momentum of the second particle follows directly from the conservation of momentum.}  \cop{However, in the quantum setting the outcome of the measurement on the first particle is completely random.} It is not possible to decide in advance to put the particle in a momentum eigenstate. Nevertheless, once the momentum of the first particle is measured, the momentum of the other particle can be predicted. The point however, is if one deiced to measure the position the the position can be predicted. 

%But this is a preparation followed by a measurement. The initial momentum measurement disturbs the position. Conversely, if one decides to measure the position, then the momentum of the other particle becomes completely undetermined.

%The uncertainty principle restricts the degree of statistical homogeneity that can be achieved in an ensemble of similarly prepared systems, thereby limiting the precision of future predictions. However, it does not by itself forbid the retrodictive reconstruction of events from the combined data of preparation and measurement within the interval between these two operations. This asymmetry, at first still to disentangle preparation and measurement, is addressed by invoking conservation laws, so as to infer without preparation. That procedure, however, is incomplete, since it employs indirect rather than direct measurements, mediated by conservation laws. Yet the trick does not seem to work: we may establish correlations between momentum and position measurements, but not before the momentum measurement. Thus, even then, reconstructing the path prior to preparation remains impossible, since preparation itself erases information about the earlier state. Popper did not learn this lesson, and simply switched to entanglement, believing that this would once again allow him to beat the \IR. 


%This asymmetry has often been addressed by invoking conservation laws, in an attempt to infer properties without explicit preparation. Such procedures, however, remain incomplete, since they rely on indirect rather than direct measurements mediated by conservation principles. Moreover, the correlations they establish do not provide simultaneous access to both momentum and position prior to measurement; they only become definite once a particular observable is measured. Thus, even then, reconstructing the path prior to preparation remains impossible, since preparation itself erases information about the earlier state. Popper later turned to entanglement, convinced that it might again offer a way to overcome the \IR.




%\cop{To bypass this, one tries to avoid direct preparation in both variables and instead exploit correlations.
%	•	Conservation laws (momentum, energy, angular momentum) give correlations between subsystems.
%	•	Entanglement (in the modern language) is exactly such correlation.
%	•	By measuring one part, you infer something about the other without having “prepared” it in the usual sense.}
%	
%	Even with correlations, you don’t beat the \IR:
%	•	What you gain is conditional knowledge (if A has momentum p, then B must have -p).

%Popper, never shwithc to entangele rather to the \IR did not help.


%\q{In conclusion, the uncertainty principle restricts the degree of statistical homogeneity which it is possible to achieve in an ensemble of similarly prepared systems, and thus it limits the precision which future predictions for any system can be made. But it does not impose any restriction on the accuracy to which an event can be reconstructed from the data of both state preparation and measurement in the time interval between these two operations.}.

%The \s{perfect mirror symmetry} ($y_A=y_B$) is broken; instead, the correlation now carries the shape of the diffraction pattern. with slit open, you see a tight diagonal line; with slit closed, you see a diagonal modulated by the diffraction fringes. Now suppose you record coincidences: every time A clicks at some y_A, you note where B clicks at the same time y_B. Without slit: coincidences line up along y_A \approx y_B. With slit: coincidences are still along a diagonal, but modulated: some diagonal regions have many dots (bright fringes), others have few (dark fringes). One can see an interference pattern in coincidences even though locally each side just sees a broad blob.

%In the double-slit case, diffraction at $A$ modifies the way $A$’s spread relates to $B$’s spread, but not the distribution of $B$ alone. $B$’s individual results remain completely random until they are compared with $A$’s through classical communication. The \s{perfect mirror symmetry} ($y_A=y_B$) that held without the slit is replaced by correlations carrying the shape of the double-slit interference pattern. If one records coincidences—matching each detection at $A$ with a simultaneous detection at $B$—the difference becomes clear: with no slit, coincidences line up along $y_A \approx y_B$; with a double slit, coincidences still fall along a diagonal, but are now modulated, with bright and dark fringes. Thus, an interference pattern appears in the coincidence counts even though each side locally shows only a broad, featureless distribution.


%If slit $A$ is closed, indeed, nothing changes in the momentum distribution of $B$, which is already maximally spread .

%the marginal $P\left(p_A\right)=\int d p_B\left|\widetilde{\Psi}\left(p_A, p_B\right)\right|^2$ is uniform. In other words, momentum is "\\s{spread out} for both particles, from the outset. Because of the perfect correlation structure, at any later time the wavefunction has the same form. As shown before, the momentum distribution is maximally spread out. 

%- Before any slit: the state $\psi\left(x_A, x_B\right)=\delta\left(x_A-x_B\right)$ already implies each particle's momentum is completely spread out. The only thing well-defined is the correlation $p_A=-p_B$. Momentum of B was already maximally spread before the slit. The flaw in Popper’s thought experiment is that he assumed B initially had a sharp momentum, so that A’s slit would somehow “spread it.” In reality, the perfect position correlation he started with already meant both A and B had completely indefinite momenta. The slit only sharpens correlations, giving conditional diffraction patterns, not new physics. $\widetilde{\psi}\left(p_A, p_B\right)=\delta\left(p_A+p_B\right)$

%Letter to Weisskopt Thanks to Viktor Weisskopt 

%That is Popper's argument. The uncertainty principle restricts the degree of statistical homogeneity that can be achieved in an ensemble of similarly prepared systems, thereby limiting the precision of future predictions. It does not, however, by itself forbid retrodictive reconstruction, from the combined data of preparation and measurement within the interval between these two operations. It was the thought, that to bypass the by using the correton,

%In fact, the argument is rather a version of the ETP argument. However, Popper reached a different conclusion. The reason ultimately seems to be that Popper misunderstood the very distinction between selection and measurement that he himself had introduced.

%1. Popper why preparation is often described as a filtering process: the apparatus selects systems with certain properties and discards the rest, so the resulting ensemble reflects only the preparation settings. Crucially, the filter does not merely disclose a pre-existing property. For this reason such operations are better seen as \s{preparations} rather than passive \s{selections.} The outgoing beams thus emerge in well-defined momentum states, precisely as a result of the preparation. One may add that different prepared states arise depending on the chosen preparation. The measurement setup determines which observable(s) are relevant, and only those are assigned definite values. This means the individuality of the object is lost in advance: before the observation, you do not know which atom will belong to the transmitted ensemble.

%2. A \s{measurement} is different, however, in that it has meaning only relative to a prior preparation. As Weisskopf pointed out, if measurements more precise than the uncertainty relations were possible, they would allow the preparation of “super-pure” ensembles, which quantum mechanics explicitly forbids. All measurements are in fact ideal preparations that project into an eigenstate of the relevant particle. That would mean one could prepare an ensemble of systems (via repeated application of such a “super-precise” measurement) in states sharper than allowed — i.e. what Pauli, Popper, and others called a “super-pure ensemble”. One might wish to deny that measurement and preparation coincide, as Margenau suggested at about the same time. However, even in this case the difficulty remains.

In his interpretation, the EPR argument was, indeed, \s{an argument against the uncertainty relations} (16). However, even this view was contested, as seen in the correspondence addressed to Popper.

However, the use of the correlation to obtaine a predictive measurement bypass the \s{preparation} fails. This is what Einstein's ETP argument showed.

He was not anymore a bearly know teahcer, bit considered one greates taken much mores sirels. Jammer made the plausible conjecture that Popper’s argument served as a mediation between the 1931 ETP argument and the later EPR argument. Indeed, Popper’s argument corresponds reforat ETP, replacing time–energy with position–momentum, as the EPR argument required. However, Popper's influence must be excluded for purely chronological reasons. Popper’s is indeed a version of the ETP argument, in which he exploits precisely the same backdoor that Einstein and his collaborators had considered possible, but had already closed. The reason is ultimately connected with Popper’s introduction of the distinction between preparation and measurement, that \citep{Margenau1974} credited for having introduced. 



%The latter produces a new state. A measuring arrangement, such as we have just finished describing in the previous section, can be used to "filter" through objects possessing a prescribed value of a certain physical quantity. It is enough to make a suitable slit through the screen on which the atoms fall to transform the Stern-Gerlach apparatus into a source of identically oriented atoms. It thus becomes a good set-up for producing pure cases.  Nevertheless, among the ensemble there exist instances (electons that happened to pass through) to which we can assign the pure-state wave function $\psi$ corresponding to the transmitted component. But this assignment is \emph{anonymous}: we cannot tell which electron has that property without performing an additional act of observation. Hence, the \s{pure cases} exist only in a collective, non-individualized sense. So when Popper claims that \s{the electron that passed through the filter} had the same momentum already before the filtering, he treats the ensemble property as an individual attribute — as if the filter revealed a pre-existing feature rather than statistically preparing a subset. That the position is also changed, 


%In quantum mechanics, a filter (say, a slit, velocity selector, or momentum filter) does not assign a definite property (momentum, position, polarization, etc.) to any individual particle. It only prepares an ensemble of systems that have, as a group, the property corresponding to a certain pure state. But crucially, before an act of observation, we cannot say which particular particle has that property. The “purity” of the prepared state is statistical and anonymous — it applies to the ensemble as a whole, not to an individually identified object. 



%If correlations allow us to ascribe both position and momentum to $B$, then the quantum description (via the wavefunction and the \IR) is incomplete, not reality itself.  This is prpoabnly this passage that conviced that the argumetn was not primaty and argeumetn agist compet, but against the \IR.

%Thus, here Einstein that the uncertainty principle cannot be an ontological statement about reality. It is possible that the second part of the argument was later conceived by Popper as a replacement for his own.

%Popper devised the ETP argument, but he misunderstood one of its most fundamental concepts—namely, the distinction between selection and measurement. Thus, Popper’s trick fails. The point is that Popper misunderstood the notion of \s{selection}, which is not really akin to that of preparation. 


%	2.	Case 1 — Position then momentum:
%	•	Measuring position of the electron first projects the total state onto one of the position-conditioned branches.
%	•	This projection acts as a preparation: it defines a new ensemble of electrons localized around the measured position.
%	•	When you subsequently measure momentum, you are not probing the “same” pre-collision electron state, but a newly prepared one — sharply defined in position, and therefore spread in momentum according to the uncertainty relation.
%	3.	Case 2 — Momentum then position:

A variant of this situation occurs when selection is made along the flight direction: due to momentum dispersion the packet spreads out, but by recording impacts with a moving film strip, one can correlate position and momentum at each instant. \todo{To Bohr might be attributed yet a third stance: retrodiction is in fact what happens in all measurements, but it is noticeably limited by complementarity only in quantum mechanical cases.}


%So to assign a \s{path} to one particle before specifying the on the other is meaningless — the state of each subsystem is not defined independently. 

% This total state is fixed and evolves deterministically, but neither particle possesses an individual state. Each has only relative states with respect to possible measurement contexts on the other. 


%The intuition behind the ETP-like strategies was to find a way  around this coupling, in order to obtain a measurement without a previous preparation that would not be constrained by the usual uncertainty relations. it defines a new ensemble of electrons localized around the measured position. When you subsequently measure momentum, you are not probing the “same” pre-collision electron state, but a newly prepared one — sharply defined in position, and therefore spread in momentum according to the uncertainty relation. The first momentum measurement now defines a different kind of ensemble — one sharply defined in momentum and delocalized in space. The first non-predicte measuremet acts as a preatio. Before the preparation (filter, slit, velocity selector), there is only an entangled total state. After the preparation, the system is engeistate of operator. No state of a subsystem exists prior to the specification of the prepeation preoceure. Therefore, any attempt to reconstruct a path before preparation





%The  retrodiction of the particle’s past trajectory, combined with non-statistical correlations such as conservation laws, seemed to allow arbitrary sharp predictions independent  of a previous preparations, thereby bypassing the \IR. Yet this trick fails, as Einstein showed, since one can only reconstruct within the context set by a preparation and a subsequent measurement\footnote{NBalletn very simpaththt tp Popper make this poit quait clar/}. If a moral can be trhgot by Poper's mistake the reconstructed past itself depends on the kind of  preparation chosen. In this sense, the preparation–measurement coupling is, indeed, central to \qm. Popper eventually recognized that his original argument was flawed, but he never fully understood the reason why. When he later attempted to substitute the original ETP-like experiment was replaced an EPR-like one \citep{DelSanto201}, new set-up was plagued by the  same difficulties, even more profoundly, the conservation could be repalded by EPR correlations.

%The path pf the particle before the momentum selectio cannot be reconstruce. Indeed, as Hermann pointed out, 




%According to the uncertainty principle, narrowing the momentum spread $\Delta p$ should increase the uncertainty in position $\Delta q$ (since $\Delta x \Delta p \gtrsim h$). But in Popper’s reasoning, a good narrow-band filter has the opposite effect: it reduces position blurring, so $\Delta q$ gets smaller as $\Delta p$ does.

%Supporting this view (in addition to other considerations) was the analogy with emission and mean lifetime: one must assume that an atom also requires a finite time for absorption. Absorption becomes very improbable, or even arbitrarily improbable, if the duration of the wave packet is much shorter than this mean lifetime. Thus, the average residence time of the relevant atom implies that very short wave trains will no longer be \s{filtered,} but will pass through largely unaffected. Popper admits this is a delicate point, but he tries to show that, at least in principle, one could have type II filters that transmit photons cleanly without producing the kind of unavoidable spatial blurring demanded by Heisenberg’s interpretation. If such filters exist, then his proposed “filter experiment” might still circumvent the uncertainty principle.



%Anticipating objections, Popper considered two possibilities. Either no such “non-blurring” filters exist, because even transmitted quanta suffer uncontrollable delays; or they exist, but only imperfectly, since absorption might lead to re-emission or incomplete suppression of unwanted wavelengths. Popper dismissed these concerns, arguing that re-emission could be made negligible and that suitably combined filters could in principle produce sharp cut-offs. On this basis he maintained that type II filters might exist, and that his proposed filter experiment could still evade the uncertainty principle.


%The question (1), whether filters of these two types exist, is itself perfectly meaningful within the current (Heisenbergian) interpretation; the further question (2), whether a filter of type II blurs position or not, would at first sight appear “meaningless” within the current interpretation, and for the following reason: a stationary state (infinitely long wave train) is eo ipso “smeared out in position.” For this reason, the question of where a light quantum is located, whose position has been registered only upon the “breaking up” of the wave train $n$ at the point counter, makes no sense. Only if one could determine such a position for the wave train before (and after) the filter, would the question of whether the filter causes spatial blurring have meaning. However, to establish a position determination before the filter, one would need an immediate shutter, and then a filter of type II would, by definition, be ineffective. It is noteworthy that the arrangement used in my thought experiment makes this previously “meaningless” question (2) appear as meaningful (I prefer, as you may recall, to avoid using the term “meaningless”). For if the experiment proceeds as I envision it (with coincident detections at $X$ and $Y$), then question (2) is decided positively; otherwise negatively. In any case, it is then decidable.




%\footnote{Popper’s second mistake was to think that because he was considering rays of photons and electrons, the information gathered through the measurement would tell us that there was a particle in the other ray with such and such properties, but it would not allow us to tell which particle that was, ergo it would not allow us to select a sub-ensemble of particles from the ray that was more informative than a quantum mechanical pure case.

%Popper’s error in treating the uncertainty relations as applying \emph{strictly} only to ensembles, thereby allowing (for a suitably chosen single case) sharper knowledge than the uncertainty bounds.   %You can talk about the \s{past} of a quantum system, but only in relation to a specific experimental setup.

%As Hermann warns her readers, such ‘backward deductions’ or ‘retrodictions’ cannot, as Popper had hoped, be extended earlier than the photon–electron inter- action. One cannot legitimately describe what happens between two consecutive position measurements on an electron or between a momentum measurement on the particle followed by a position measurement because such narratives fail to take into account both the duality of the quantum object and the fact that there are two different ‘observational contexts at play’. Physically speaking, these descriptions of past paths are meaningless, ‘empty’ %Bohr’s Slit and Hermann’s Microscope

%precise non-predictive measurements have far-reaching implications, Popper found it necessary to examine the legitimacy of this assumption in more detail, a task he undertakes in Appendix VI, where he himself ultimately questions the premise. That the position is not disturbed is a key premise of Popper’s, as we shall see.

%\subsection{The Experimental Set-Up}


%Against this, she insisted that the duality experiments and the uncertainty relations constrain \emph{each} elementary process, and that wave functions legitimately describe \emph{individual} systems as well.\footnote{Paraphrasing Grete Hermann’s March 1935 critique; cf. her discussion of Popper’s \textit{Logik der Forschung} (Vienna 1935).}. However, Hermann was also critial of Heseiber one claim that is a qustion of state. Indeed, is a qestion of context. It epdens on what you desice to reconstruc.



%\cop{Such constructions actively disregard the essential fact that each specification of a variable only has meaning relative to an observational context. To treat a trajectory as if it had physical meaning is to ignore this constitutive feature of quantum mechanics. Hence, it is not just “a matter of taste” but physically meaningless.} \cop{If you measure position at successive times (e.g., two position measurements in a row), you can try to reconstruct a kind of trajectory in terms of positions. But this trajectory is already tied to the fact that you chose a position–position context. If instead you measure momentum and then position, the “reconstruction” will look different, because you’ve combined two different contexts (momentum first, then position). The uncertainty relations mean you cannot combine these into one single consistent picture of the past; they yield different, mutually incompatible reconstructions.}. Hermann stresses that it is meaningless to pretend these reconstructions can be fused into a single classical-like trajectory that would hold \s{independently} of the measurement context. That’s what she means when she says that mixing variables from different contexts into one representation “exceeds the uncertainty relations” and becomes physically vacuous.



%For this reason, it is impossible to reconstruct the path prior to the momentum  selection. Popper’s claim in the second case represents a fundamental  misunderstanding of the very notion of preparation.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Preparation in a position eigenstate followed by a momentum measurement 
%  yields one kind of reconstructed trajectory (sharp initial position, later momentum).
%  \item Preparation in a momentum eigenstate followed by a position measurement 
%  yields a different, incompatible reconstruction (sharp initial momentum, later position).
%\end{itemize} Since these reconstructions belong to different observational contexts, they 
%cannot be fused into a single context-free trajectory. Any attempt to combine 
%them into one representation exceeds the uncertainty relations and becomes 
%physically meaningless.


%That a way non-rseonca are once agin.  
%
%
%Grete Hermann distinguishes between two types of inference. On the one hand are posterior reconstructions of an electron’s trajectory, such as when one tries to calculate exact positions and momenta from successive measurements. These combine variables from different observational contexts into a single description and thereby appear to exceed the limits set by the uncertainty relations. Hermann argues that such reconstructions are physically meaningless, since they ignore the wave–particle duality and the relativity of quantum descriptions.  
%
%On the other hand are causal inferences that belong to the interpretation of a measurement itself. These must respect the dual character of atomic processes, where each observation situates wave and particle aspects in relation to one another, depending on the experimental set-up. For example, a microscope observation may be interpreted either in terms of sharp position with unsharp momentum, or vice versa, depending on the observational context. In this way the uncertainty relations are preserved.  
%
%Hermann concludes that calculations of trajectories which mix observational contexts provide no valid predictions, while inferences grounded in the duality of measurement contexts remain meaningful and testable.

A large part of the manuscript is devoted to refuting Schlick's claim that the laws of physics are pseudo-propositions, as presented in his 1931 paper on causality, which Schlick knew very well.

%In retrospect, Popper himself would later describe these efforts as \q{a gross mistake for which I have been deeply sorry and ashamed ever since} \citep[15\hide]{Popper1982}.  For this reason, recent literature has referred to this episode only in passing, ultimately dismissing it as a youthful blunder, and concetrate on his work 1980s.
